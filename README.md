# Consume! This! Particular! Burger!

Hi there, and welcome to "Consume! This! Particular! Burger!" - hereafter referred to as CTPB - a leading technology on the virtual creation and subsequent destruction of burger-objects. CTPB is for the dreamers of the world who would like to keep a running database of eaten and uneaten burger-objects. The goal of CTPB is to give a simulation experience of putting a burger-object into a database and modifying it's attributes. The contents of CTPB are inherintely safe for all ages, but I'd be a liar if I said burger-objects couldn't be an adult's game. If you have any questions please ask them in the form of a burger-object. 

Burger onwards!
